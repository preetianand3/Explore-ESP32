# ESP32 Projects and Experiments  

This repository contains my explorations, projects, and implementations using the **ESP32 microcontroller**. The ESP32 is a powerful and versatile chip that supports **Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and various peripherals**, making it ideal for IoT and embedded systems.  

## **About ESP32**  

### **What is ESP32?**  
ESP32 is a low-cost, power-efficient system-on-chip (SoC) developed by **Espressif Systems**. It is widely used in **IoT (Internet of Things)**, **embedded systems**, and **wireless applications** due to its rich set of features and ease of programming.

### **Key Features of ESP32**  
- **Dual-Core Xtensa LX6** CPU (up to 240 MHz)  
- **Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n) & Bluetooth 4.2/BLE**  
- **Low Power Consumption** with deep sleep modes  
- **34 GPIO pins** (varies by board) with support for:  
  - **PWM, IÂ²C, SPI, UART, ADC, DAC**  
  - **Capacitive touch sensors**  
- **Built-in Security** (AES, SHA, RSA encryption)  
- **High-Speed Communication** (SPI, IÂ²C, UART, CAN, I2S)  
- **4MB Flash memory**, **520KB SRAM** (varies by board)  

### **ESP32 Development Board used**  
- **ESP32-WROOM-32** (Most common)    

## **Programming ESP32**  
I have used the following to program ESP32:  
- **Arduino IDE** (Beginner-friendly)   

## **Applications of ESP32**  
ESP32 is used in various real-world applications, including:  
- **Smart Home Automation** (Wi-Fi-controlled devices)  
- **IoT & Cloud Connectivity** (MQTT, Firebase, AWS IoT)  
- **Wearables & Health Monitoring** (BLE applications)  
- **Industrial Automation** (Sensor-based applications)  
- **Robotics & AI Edge Computing** (ESP32-S3 with TensorFlow Lite)
